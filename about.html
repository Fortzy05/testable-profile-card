      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate front-end developer with a strong focus on creating intuitive and visually appealing web experiences.
        My journey began with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and over time, I have gained hands-on experience
        with modern frameworks like React and Next.js. I thrive on turning complex designs into seamless interfaces, and I
        prioritize writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code that enhances user experience. Beyond coding, I am committed
        to continuous learning, adapting to new technologies, and keeping up with the ever-evolving web development landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to technical skills, I value collaboration and communication. Working in teams allows me to learn from
        others’ perspectives while contributing my own expertise. I take pride in creating projects that are accessible,
        responsive, and performant, ensuring a high-quality experience for every user.

    <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
      <h2>Goals in this Program</h2>
      <p>
        My goals in this program are multifaceted. First, I aim to deepen my understanding of responsive web design principles,
        ensuring that all applications I build provide a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
        I also want to enhance my knowledge of accessibility standards, ensuring that my projects are usable by everyone,
        including people with disabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another key goal is to strengthen my front-end development skills by building fully functional web applications that
        integrate APIs, manage state efficiently, and handle user input effectively. Additionally, I want to gain experience
        with version control, testing, and deployment processes, so that my workflow aligns with professional industry practices.
      </p>

    <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
      <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
      <p>
        While I am comfortable with most front-end development tasks, there are areas I am actively working to improve.
        Advanced JavaScript concepts, including closures, asynchronous programming, and performance optimization, remain
        challenging at times. I also want to improve my understanding of state management in React, particularly when handling
        complex data flows and large-scale applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I seek to enhance my testing skills, including writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Gaining
        confidence in debugging complex applications and implementing scalable architectures are also on my development roadmap.
        Recognizing these areas allows me to focus my learning and track my progress throughout this program.

    <section data-testid="test-about-future-note">
      <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
      <p>
        Keep pushing forward, stay curious, and embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. Remember that consistent
        effort and deliberate practice are key to mastery in any discipline. Don’t be afraid to experiment with new frameworks,
        tools, or design patterns, and always prioritize building applications that provide value to users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep a mindset of lifelong learning, documenting insights and lessons along the way. Celebrate small wins, reflect
        on mistakes, and continuously iterate on your skills. Future self, stay patient and persistent—your dedication will
        pay off in the form of expertise and meaningful projects.

    <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
      <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond web development, I am deeply interested in user experience, web performance optimization, and contributing
        to open-source projects. I believe that sharing knowledge strengthens the community, and I try to mentor and
        collaborate whenever possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with design systems, and keeping up-to-date with emerging
        trends in front-end development. My ultimate goal is to not just build websites, but to craft digital experiences
        that are accessible, inclusive, and impactful.
